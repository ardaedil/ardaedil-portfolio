# Menlo Innovations — Student Software Consultant → Product / Project Manager

## Context
I worked as a **student software consultant** on a real client engagement with Menlo Innovations. The work involved ambiguous requirements, evolving constraints, and direct collaboration with stakeholders. Over time, I expanded from primarily technical contributions into a product and project leadership role.

This experience reflects both hands-on engineering work and ownership over planning, execution, and delivery.

## Role 1: Software Engineering Consultant

### Project: Project Punch
I contributed to the design and implementation of backend systems used to process and manage operational data for internal workflows.

### What I worked on
- Designed and implemented backend components in **Java** for a production-facing internal system
- Built data ingestion and processing pipelines to automate operational workflows
- Improved reliability and maintainability through testing, refactoring, and clearer system boundaries
- Collaborated closely with other engineers in a test-driven, iterative development environment

### Impact
- Significantly reduced manual operational overhead by automating recurring workflows
- Improved data consistency and availability for downstream use
- Contributed to a system actively used by internal teams

## Role 2: Product / Project Manager (Current)

As the project evolved, I took on ownership beyond implementation, transitioning into a **product and project management role**.

### Responsibilities
- Owned project planning, task breakdown, and milestone tracking
- Translated high-level operational needs into concrete technical requirements
- Balanced scope, timelines, and technical constraints while maintaining forward progress
- Acted as a bridge between stakeholders and engineers to reduce ambiguity

### Impact
- Improved execution speed by clarifying priorities and technical direction
- Enabled engineers to focus on implementation by removing blockers and uncertainty
- Maintained momentum across an evolving project with changing requirements

## What This Experience Demonstrates
- Ability to work effectively with **unclear or evolving requirements**
- Comfort taking **ownership** beyond narrowly defined tasks
- Strong foundation in backend systems alongside product-oriented thinking
- Experience operating in small, high-trust teams with real delivery expectations
