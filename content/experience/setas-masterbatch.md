# Setas Masterbatch — Supply Chain Analyst Intern (Istanbul, Türkiye)

## Overview
I worked as a Supply Chain Analyst Intern at Setas Masterbatch, where I built demand forecasting models to improve planning and reduce stockouts.

## What I did
- Developed demand forecasting models under Dr. M. Emre Sener.
- Replaced a baseline k-means approach with agglomerative clustering in Python (scikit-learn).

## Impact
- Improved forecast accuracy by ~13% in offline backtests.
- Increased on-time material availability by +8 percentage points.
- Reduced stockouts by ~20%.
- Enabled purchasing about ~10 days earlier through improved planning and supplier coordination.
