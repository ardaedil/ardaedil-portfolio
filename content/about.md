# About Me

I’m a Computer Science student (BSE) at the University of Michigan with a strong interest in building systems that are both technically rigorous and genuinely useful to people. I enjoy working on problems where requirements are ambiguous, constraints are real, and ownership matters.

I’m originally from Istanbul, Turkey, and I’m currently based in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Outside of engineering, I’m deeply interested in soccer — I support Galatasaray and play futsal with Wolverine F.C. at Michigan.

## How I Think as an Engineer

I’m motivated by problems that involve complexity, unclear structure, and real-world constraints. I like understanding systems end-to-end — from backend logic and data flow to how users actually interact with a product.

I care a lot about:
- Writing maintainable code that others can understand
- Understanding *why* a system behaves the way it does
- Making tradeoffs explicit (velocity vs. correctness vs. scope)

I’m comfortable working independently, but I also value tight feedback loops with teammates and stakeholders.

## What I Enjoy Working On

I especially enjoy:
- Full-stack systems where I can own features end-to-end
- AI-augmented products where models are grounded in real data
- Backend-heavy work involving data processing, APIs, and system design
- Projects where requirements evolve and I need to adapt quickly

I’m also interested in research at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and applied systems, particularly where technology helps people regulate, understand, or augment real-world behavior.

## How I Work With Teams

In team settings, I tend to naturally take on ownership roles — helping define scope, break down work, and keep projects moving forward. I’ve worked closely with designers, engineers, and non-technical stakeholders, and I enjoy translating ambiguous requirements into concrete execution plans.

I value clarity, accountability, and thoughtful communication.

## What I’m Looking For

I’m currently looking for opportunities where I can:
- Work on meaningful, production-facing systems
- Take ownership of real features, not just isolated tasks
- Learn from experienced engineers while contributing real value
- Grow in environments that reward initiative and responsibility
