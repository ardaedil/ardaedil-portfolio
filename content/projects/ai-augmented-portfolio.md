# AI-Augmented Portfolio Website  
**Full-Stack Engineering · AI Systems · Human-Centered Design**

---

## Overview
I built my personal portfolio as an **AI-augmented web application** rather than a static website.

Instead of scrolling through pages, visitors can **ask questions directly** about my experience, projects, and skills, and receive answers grounded strictly in my real work.

This project combines modern frontend engineering with practical AI system design.

---

## Problem
Traditional portfolios are:
- Static and hard to explore
- Optimized for scanning, not understanding
- Poor at conveying depth across multiple projects

I wanted a portfolio that:
- Encourages exploration
- Explains *why* decisions were made
- Adapts to what the viewer wants to know

---

## Solution
An AI-powered portfolio that answers questions **only using my actual experience**, backed by a structured knowledge base.

The AI acts as an interface to my work — not a generic chatbot.

---

## What I Built

### Frontend
- Built a responsive **Next.js** application with Tailwind CSS
- Designed an interactive chat UI embedded directly into the portfolio
- Implemented concise vs. detailed response modes for different audiences

### AI Backend
- Built a server-side API using **OpenAI’s Responses API**
- Implemented a **retrieval system** that:
  - Reads structured Markdown files (`/content`)
  - Grounds answers strictly in my resume, experience, and project writeups
  - Prevents hallucinated or generic responses

### Knowledge Architecture
- Structured content into:
  - Experience
  - Projects
  - Research
- Designed the system so new projects automatically become AI-queryable
- Ensured answers reflect *how I talk about my own work* (first-person, professional)

---

## Why This Matters
This project demonstrates:
- Practical AI integration beyond demos
- Full-stack ownership from UI → backend → data modeling
- Thoughtful system design under real constraints
- A user-centered approach to information access

It reflects how I approach engineering problems:
**build systems that make complex information easier to understand.**

---

## Skills & Technologies
- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** API routes, server-side rendering
- **AI Systems:** OpenAI Responses API, retrieval grounding
- **System Design:** Content modeling, safety constraints, UX tradeoffs

---

## Why I Built This
I enjoy building tools that sit at the intersection of:
- Software engineering
- AI-assisted systems
- Human-centered design

This portfolio is both a project and a philosophy:  
**software should explain itself well.**
