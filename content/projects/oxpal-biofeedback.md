## Overview
I contributed to the OxPal research project, which resulted in a Springer publication titled *OxPal: Empowering Children with Stress Regulation Through Biofeedback*. The system is a child-friendly biofeedback device and application designed to help children aged ~7–11 regulate stress through breathing techniques. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

OxPal addresses a gap in accessible biofeedback tools: many existing approaches were either costly or not optimized for long-term use by children. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## What I Built
- Helped implement and integrate a **biofeedback device** using photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors to track physiological signals (heart rate variability, breathing patterns). :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
- Built parts of the **mobile application** that interprets the real-time data from the device.
- Designed systems to display **personalized breathing guidance** tailored to the user’s physiological data.
- Worked with interdisciplinary teams (design, research, engineering) on both hardware interface and software data interpretation.

## Research Context
OxPal uses PPG sensors (non-invasive and cost-effective) to measure physiological signals. Its companion app interprets those signals, offers effective breathing techniques, and encourages children to self-regulate stress. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

This work was published at the Human-Computer Interaction International 2024 conference and included in *Communications in Computer and Information Science* (CCIS, vol. 2321). :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## Impact
- Provided evidence-backed stress regulation support in a mobile + hardware biofeedback context.
- Demonstrated the feasibility of a *child-focused physiological regulation tool*.
- Strengthened my skills in biomedical sensing, real-time data processing, and interdisciplinary research collaboration.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Biofeedback sensor integration (PPG)
- Physiological signal interpretation
- Mobile software engineering
- Cross-disciplinary research and publication
