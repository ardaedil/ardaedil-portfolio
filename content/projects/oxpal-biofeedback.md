## Problem
Most biofeedback tools for stress regulation are:
- Designed primarily for adults
- Expensive, closed-source, or difficult to access
- Not optimized for long-term use by children

Children (ages ~7–11) often struggle with stress regulation but lack accessible tools that combine **physiological sensing**, **real-time feedback**, and **child-friendly interaction design**.

---

## Solution
**OxPal** is a child-friendly biofeedback system designed to help children regulate stress through guided breathing.

The system consists of:
- A **PPG-based biofeedback device** that measures physiological signals
- A **mobile application** that interprets those signals in real time
- **Personalized breathing guidance** that responds to the user’s physiological state

OxPal emphasizes accessibility, simplicity, and sustained engagement rather than clinical complexity.

## My Role
I worked on OxPal as part of an interdisciplinary HCI research team, contributing across **hardware integration, signal processing, and mobile software development**.

## What I Built

### Biofeedback & Signal Processing
- Integrated **photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors** to collect real-time cardiovascular data
- Helped implement signal preprocessing pipelines:
  - Noise reduction
  - Baseline normalization
  - Moving-average filtering
- Assisted in computing **heart rate variability (HRV)** metrics (e.g., SDNN) used as indicators of stress

### Mobile Application
- Built components of the **mobile app** that:
  - Receives real-time data from the biofeedback device
  - Visualizes heart rate and HRV in a child-friendly interface
  - Delivers **guided breathing exercises** based on physiological signals
- Focused on clarity, engagement, and age-appropriate interaction design

### Research & Collaboration
- Collaborated with researchers, designers, and engineers in an **HCI-focused research environment**
- Contributed to system iteration, evaluation framing, and technical documentation
- Co-authored a **peer-reviewed Springer publication**

---

## Impact
- Demonstrated the feasibility of a **low-cost, child-centered biofeedback system**
- Showed how physiological sensing and mobile software can support emotional self-regulation
- Contributed to an **open, research-driven alternative** to commercial biofeedback tools
- Strengthened my interest in **Human–Computer Interaction, applied AI, and human-centered systems**

---

## Skills & Technologies
- **Physiological Computing:** PPG sensing, HRV metrics, signal preprocessing  
- **Mobile Engineering:** Bluetooth data flow, real-time visualization  
- **HCI Research:** Child-centered design, usability, interdisciplinary collaboration  
- **Systems Thinking:** Hardware–software integration, real-time feedback loops

## Why This Project Matters to Me
OxPal reinforced my interest in building systems that sit at the intersection of **technology, human behavior, and real-world impact**. I enjoy working on problems where engineering decisions directly shape how people experience and benefit from technology—especially in human-centered and research-driven contexts.
