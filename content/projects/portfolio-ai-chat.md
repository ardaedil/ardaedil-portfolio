# AI-Powered Portfolio Website

## Overview
I built my personal portfolio as an AI-augmented web application rather than a static site.

## What I built
- Next.js frontend with a clean, responsive layout
- A backend AI API using OpenAI’s Responses API
- A **retrieval system** that reads markdown files as the AI’s knowledge base
- A chat interface that answers questions grounded only in my real experience

## Why this matters
- Demonstrates full-stack engineering skills
- Shows practical AI integration, not just UI
- Makes my experience explorable instead of static

## Skills Demonstrated
- Full-stack development
- Backend API design
- AI-augmented systems
