# AI Stock Analyzer

## Overview
I built an AI-powered stock analysis system that combines financial data with retrieval-augmented generation to surface insights.

## What I built
- Implemented a **RAG pipeline** using LangChain and FAISS
- Designed prompt strategies using **ReAct** reasoning
- Processed and embedded financial datasets for retrieval
- Built an interface for querying stocks with natural language

## Key Results
- Improved prediction accuracy by approximately **13%**
- Reduced noise in model responses through retrieval filtering
- Demonstrated practical AI integration beyond simple prompting

## Skills Demonstrated
- AI system design
- Retrieval-augmented generation
- Data preprocessing and evaluation
